# flatpak-pages-repo
Flatpak repository hosted on github pages

The workflow used is largely stolen from: https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/flatpak-remote

# Todo?:
- Use a flatpak bundle instead of building?
- Generate .flatpakref file
- Generate .flatpakrepo file
- Split workflow into multiple jobs
- Generate a download/instructions page?
